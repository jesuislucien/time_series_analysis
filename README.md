# time_series_analysis

#### In this repo, I share my implementation code for popular time series and econometric models.

#### Feel free to add something valuable to this code if you think something need to be done!

Time series analysis helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time. 
Using data visualizations, business users can see seasonal trends and dig deeper into why these trends occur. 
With modern analytics platforms, these visualizations can go far beyond line graphs.
